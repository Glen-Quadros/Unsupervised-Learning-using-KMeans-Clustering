# Unsupervised-Learning-using-KMeans-Clustering

This is an unsupervised machine learning project. The dataset for this project was downloaded from kaggle.

In this, the aim of this project was to create groups of countries based on their socio-economic factors to help in deciding on the recipents of the financial aid.

I use pandas inorder to read the dataset and then I proceed to find if there's any missing data. I use seaborn and plot differnt values inorder to finf the outliers and drop them.

I then use KMeans Clustering to cluster the data. In order to find the best K value, I use elbow/knee method. I then create the final model using the K value and make cluster labels using this machine learning model.

I finally use plotly and make a interactive plot using the dataset and the clusters I just made.
